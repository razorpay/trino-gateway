# Devstack Skill Changelog

## Version 1.0.7 (2026-04-30)

### Deterministic Behavior Fixes

Three changes to eliminate non-deterministic behavior:

**1. Deployment method: helmfile by default**
Added explicit rule: always use helmfile unless user explicitly says "use v2". werf is a tool used internally by helmfile (not an alternative to it). v2 is the only separate deployment system. Never infer deployment method from context.

**2. Onboarding: own knowledge base only**
Added strict rule against copying or inferring chart structure from other existing services in kube-manifests. Each service must be onboarded from this skill's templates, adapted to that service's actual configuration.

**3. Onboarding: image tag discovery from CI (Phase 1.5)**
Added mandatory pre-configuration phase that discovers the service's image tag pattern by reading its GitHub Actions workflows before writing any chart. Supports:
- Razorpay composite action (`razorpay/actions/docker-image-build-push`)
- Open source action (`docker/build-push-action`)

If the tag pattern is ambiguous, the skill asks the user for a sample image tag or workflow file — it never guesses.

## Version 1.0.6 (2026-04-13)

### New Feature: Debezium CDC for Ephemeral PostgreSQL

Added support for Debezium CDC on devstack, enabling Change Data Capture from ephemeral PostgreSQL databases — the PostgreSQL equivalent of the existing Maxwell CDC for MySQL.

**What's new:**
- `references/debezium-cdc-sop.md` — full SOP for setting up ephemeral Debezium connectors
- Debezium CDC template section added to `references/helm-chart-templates.md`
- `debezium-cdc.yaml` added to helm chart directory structure

**How it works:**
- Add `ephemeral_debezium: true` to helmfile values alongside `ephemeral_db: true`
- Add a `debezium-cdc.yaml` template to your helm chart (one-time setup)
- On deploy, a `DebeziumInstance` CR is created in the `debezium` namespace
- The debezium-operator registers a connector on Kafka Connect
- CDC events flow to dev-serve MSK with `DEVSTACK_LABEL` and `Async-Target-Consumer` headers
- On teardown, the connector is automatically cleaned up via finalizer

**Key differences from Maxwell CDC:**
- PostgreSQL logical replication (not MySQL binlog)
- Operator registers connectors on shared Kafka Connect (no per-instance Deployment)
- Requires `debezium_publication` pre-created on PG database (handled by db-configurator)
- CR namespace is `debezium` (not `maxwell-microservices`)

**Reference implementation:** `helmfile/charts/optimizer-core/templates/debezium-cdc.yaml`

### Files Updated
- `references/debezium-cdc-sop.md` — New file: complete Debezium CDC SOP
- `references/helm-chart-templates.md` — Added Debezium CDC template section and directory listing
- `SKILL.md` — Added Debezium CDC SOP reference in support section
- `CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## Version 1.0.4 (2026-03-24)

### Auto-Clone kube-manifests Repository

When the helmfile directory is not found locally, the skill now automatically clones the kube-manifests repository instead of stopping and asking the user to clone manually.

**Clone priority order:**
1. `gh` CLI (handles auth seamlessly via `gh repo clone`)
2. `git` CLI (fallback via `git clone --depth 1 --single-branch`)
3. Fail with clear instructions if neither works

This removes a manual step for new users and agent-based workflows (e.g. SWE Agent) where prompting the user is not ideal.

## Version 1.0.2 (2026-02-04)

### New Feature: Devstack v2 (devstackctl) Support

**Overview**: Added comprehensive support for installing and configuring devstack v2 (devstackctl), the modern CLI for devstack operations.

#### 1. Installation Workflow

**GitHub CLI Requirement** (Private Repository):
- devstackctl binary is hosted in private `razorpay/devstack-v2` repository
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) required for authenticated download
- Installation steps:
  1. Install GitHub CLI (`brew install gh` / `apt install gh`)
  2. Authenticate with `gh auth login`
  3. Download using `gh release download`

**Platform Support**:
- macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3 Macs)
- macOS Intel (x86_64)
- Linux ARM64
- Linux AMD64

**Installation Command**:
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (works with private repo)
gh release download v0.5.0 -R razorpay/devstack-v2 -p "devstackctl-darwin-arm64" -O ~/.devstack/bin/devstackctl --clobber
chmod +x ~/.devstack/bin/devstackctl
```

#### 2. Post-Deployment IngressRoute Display

After every successful `devstackctl deploy`, the skill displays all IngressRoute access URLs:

**Output Format**:
```
### Access URLs

| Type | URL | Port | Header Required |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|
| With Header | `https://pg-router.dev.razorpay.in` | 80 | `rzpctx-dev-serve-user: parag` |
| With Header | `https://pg-router.dev.razorpay.in` | 81 | `rzpctx-dev-serve-user: parag` |
| Direct Access | `https://pg-router-parag.dev.razorpay.in` | 80 | None (auto-injected) |
| Direct Access | `https://pg-router-parag.dev.razorpay.in` | 81 | None (auto-injected) |
```

**Route Types**:
- **Header-Based Routes**: Shared domain requiring `rzpctx-dev-serve-user` header
- **Direct Access Routes**: Dedicated domain with auto-injected headers

#### 3. Key Features

## Version 1.0.1 (2026-02-02)

### Breaking Change: CPU Limits Removed

**Rationale**: CPU limits cause unnecessary throttling even when CPU is available on the node, leading to performance degradation. Removing CPU limits allows applications to burst and use available CPU resources without artificial restrictions.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed CPU limit configurations from all helm chart templates
- Updated documentation to explain why CPU limits are not used
- Modified auto-fix strategies to NOT add CPU limits
- Updated validation checklists to reflect best practice of no CPU limits

**Impact**:
- Applications will no longer be throttled by CPU limits
- Better performance during CPU bursts
- More efficient resource utilization on nodes
- CPU requests still in place to guarantee minimum CPU allocation

**Migration Guide**:
- Existing deployments: No action required, CPU limits can remain if already deployed
- New deployments: Will automatically be created without CPU limits
- To remove CPU limits from existing charts: Delete `web_limits_cpu` and `worker_limits_cpu` from values.yaml and remove from deployment templates

### Bug Fixes & Enhancements

**RBAC Permission Error Handling**
- Added error pattern detection for RBAC permission denied errors
- Pattern: `forbidden: User "<user@email.com>" cannot list resource "secrets" in API group "" in the namespace "<namespace>"`
- Auto-detection of cluster access issues
- Guided workflow for cluster access provisioning
- Integration with cluster access pipeline at deploy.razorpay.com
- Validation commands for verifying RBAC permissions
- Cluster context verification (dev-serve)

**User Experience Improvements**
- Removed incorrect "Expected Output" sections from user onboarding documentation
- Clear guidance on running cluster access pipeline
- Alternative onboarding flow for users without pipeline access
- Step-by-step validation after access provisioning
- Better error messages for permission issues

### Documentation Updates

**Helm Chart Location Clarification**
- Added critical warnings throughout documentation emphasizing that helm charts MUST be created/updated in `helmfile/charts/<application-name>` within the kube-manifests repository ONLY
- Updated onboarding subskill with prominent location requirements
- Updated helm-chart-templates reference with path specifications
- Updated path-detection reference to include chart location guidance
